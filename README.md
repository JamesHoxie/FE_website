# FE_website
A mini wiki type website to store information about Fire Emblem characters   

This is a personal project made to demonstrate my skill set to potential employers.  
Simply visit this url to demo the site hosted on heroku : https://fe-character-profiles-site.herokuapp.com/  

The site implements basic CRUD operations on a character profile model and user model stored on a MongoDB Atlas database.  
First create an account by navigating to the signup page: https://fe-character-profiles-site.herokuapp.com/signup   
Once you have created an account you can view, update, and delete profiles stored in the database or create new profiles to add to the database.
